I'm Ved Topkar, a fifth year MD/PhD student at Stanford Medical School interested in RNA biology, entrepreneurship, and computer science education.

Currently, I work as a Biophysics PhD student in the Das Lab. A summary of my current and previous research experiences can be found at the research and publications pages.

In the past, I was involved with Beacon Genomics, a genome editing specificity and safety company spun out of the Joung Lab. Before that, I co-founded and co-exited the education technology company Keystone Learning Systems.

If you are interested in connecting or collaborating, feel free to contact me.
